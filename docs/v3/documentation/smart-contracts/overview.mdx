# Introduction

Smart contract creation, development, and deployment on TON Blockchain utilizes the [FunC programming language](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#-func) and the [TON Virtual Machine (TVM)](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#ton-virtual-machine-tvm).

## Quick start: your first smart contract

To write and deploy your first smart contract, use the *Blueprint* framework.

*Blueprint* is a development environment that simplifies writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on TON Blockchain.

To create a new demo project, run the following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### TON course

:::tip
Before starting the course, ensure you have a solid understanding of blockchain technology. If there are gaps in your knowledge, we recommend taking the [Blockchain Basics with TON course](https://stepik.org/course/201294/promo), which is available in [Russian](https://stepik.org/course/202221/) and [Chinese](https://stepik.org/course/200976/).
:::

We proudly present the **TON Blockchain course**, a comprehensive guide designed for developers who want to learn how to create smart contracts and decentralized applications on TON Blockchain.

The course consists of 9 modules and covers:
- The basics of TON Blockchain.
- The smart contract development lifecycle.
- The FunC programming language.
- The TON Virtual Machine (TVM).

## Examples of smart contracts

Explore ready-made smart contract examples and tools provided by the TON community.

:::info little tip
Focusing on smart contracts written in FunC `.fc` rather than the lower-level Fift `.fif` language is often more beneficial.
:::

Standard examples of smart contracts on TON include wallets, electors which manage validation on TON, and multi-signature wallets. These can serve as excellent references during your studies.

### Tact

Tact is a fresh programming language for TON Blockchain, focused on efficiency and ease of development. It fits complex smart contracts, quick onboarding, and rapid prototyping.

Developed by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io), powered by the community — by the end of 2024, the number of _unique code_[^1] contracts deployed on the mainnet reached almost 28 thousand, of which about 33% were written in Tact.

View some of the selected projects: [Tact in production](https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact#tact-in-production-).

[^1]: The "unique code" means that each contract in the data sample has at least one TVM instruction that differs from the other contracts, excluding many preprocessed wallets with everything inlined — even seqno and a public key for signature verification!
