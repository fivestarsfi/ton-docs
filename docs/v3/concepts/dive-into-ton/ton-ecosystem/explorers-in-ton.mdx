# Explorers in TON

In this article, we will consider TON explorers, their capabilities and features from the point of view of the developer.

## What is an explorer?

An explorer is a website that allows you to view information in a blockchain, such as the account balance, transaction history, blocks, etc.

## Which explorers exist?

Among TON explorers, you can distinguish several categories:

- For everyday use
- With extended information for developers
- Specialized

This division into categories is largely conditional and one explorer can belong to several categories at the same time. So let's not pay too much attention to this.

## General functionality

Blockchain explorers are tools that allow you to view and search the blockchain in a way similar to how you might use a banking app to check transaction history and account balances. They provide a user-friendly interface to access real-time data about blockchain transactions, blocks, and addresses.

Just as you use a banking app to track where your money goes, who sends you payments, and when transactions occur, blockchain explorers let you see this kind of information for digital assets on the blockchain. They are essential for transparency, allowing anyone to verify transactions independently, see the flow of cryptocurrency, and analyze the activity on the blockchain.
