# Explorers in TON

In this article, we will consider TON explorers, their capabilities and features from the point of view of the developer.

## What is an explorer?

An explorer is a website that allows you to view information in a blockchain, such as the account balance, transaction history, blocks, etc.

## Which explorers exist?

Among TON explorers, you can distinguish several categories:

- For everyday use
- With extended information for developers
- Specialized

This division into categories is largely conditional and one explorer can belong to several categories at the same time. So let's not pay too much attention to this.


## Address alias in explorers

Make your service address more user-friendly by using an address alias. Create Pull Requests (PRs) according to the provided guidelines:

- [tonkeeper/ton-assets](https://github.com/tonkeeper/ton-assets) - Tonviewer.com alias
- [catchain/address-book](https://github.com/catchain/address-book)- Tonscan.org alias
- [ton-labels](https://github.com/ton-studio/ton-labels) - Public dataset of labelled TON blockchain addresses


## General functionality

Blockchain explorers are tools that allow you to view and search the blockchain in a way similar to how you might use a banking app to check transaction history and account balances. They provide a user-friendly interface to access real-time data about blockchain transactions, blocks, and addresses.

Just as you use a banking app to track where your money goes, who sends you payments, and when transactions occur, blockchain explorers let you see this kind of information for digital assets on the blockchain. They are essential for transparency, allowing anyone to verify transactions independently, see the flow of cryptocurrency, and analyze the activity on the blockchain.

These explorers are particularly useful for verifying that transactions have been processed and for checking the status of digital wallets. They make the blockchain accessible and understandable, turning complex data into readable information, which helps bridge the gap between advanced blockchain technology and everyday users.
